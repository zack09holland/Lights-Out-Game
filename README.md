# Lights-Out-Game
React web application of one of my favorite games growing up!

## Description
LightsOut is based on a deceptively simple concept. Clicking on a cell toggles that cell and each of its immediate neighbors. The goal is to turn out all the lights, ideally with the minimum number of clicks.

## Instructions
1. git clone the repository
1. cd lights-out
1. run 'npm start'
1. Play the game!
